Given a matrix with 0’s and 1’s , you enter the matrix at cell (0,0) in left to right direction. whenever you encounter a 0 you retain in same direction , if you encounter a 1’s you have to change direction to right of current direction and change that 1 value to 0, you have to find out from which index you will leave the matrix at the end.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines . The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m denoting the size of the matrix. Then in the next line are n*m space separated values of the matrix.

Output:
For each test case print in a new line two integers separated by space denoting the index of the matrix from which you will leave the matrix at the end.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=n,m<=20

Example:
Input:
2
3 3
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 4
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
Output:
2 2 
0 2
