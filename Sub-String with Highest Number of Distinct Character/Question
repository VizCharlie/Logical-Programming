Given a string detect the smallest window length with highest number of distinct characters.
For eg. A = “aabcbcdbca”, then the result would be 4 as of the smallest window will be “dbca” .

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a string S.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the length of the smallest such string.

Constraints:
1<=T<100
1<=|S|<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
aabcbcdbca
aaab

Output:
4
2
